1. Description

JBSSN evolves Einstein's Equations with the BSSN formulation for scalar tensor theories in Jordan frame.
 For the conformal factor it uses the "W" version, i.e. W=\gamma^{-1/6}, and it employs
the usual "1+log" and "Gamma-driver" gauge conditions.

The JBSSN formulation is taken from arxiv.2406.05211

The decoupling expression for the scalar field in Einstein frame was derived from arxiv.1505.07462 
For DEF theory in Einstein frame we use the coupling function defined in arxiv.1707.05280

The module implements a simple 2nd and 4th order finite difference scheme, plans to include 6th order.


The initial data for the scalar field can be set using ScalarInitial thorn, with a new module that allows to read HDF5 files.
